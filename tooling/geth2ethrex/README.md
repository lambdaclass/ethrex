# Post-merge Sync

Post-merge sync can be achieved for Ethrex by full-syncing Geth to the right head, then using the `geth2ethrex` tool to update the Database.

## Step 1: Syncing Geth

The most efficient way to sync Geth to an arbitrary block is by full-syncing and telling it to stop afterwards:

```shell
# This syncs to post-merge mainnet.
# You'll need to fetch the right block's hash, this one is taken from Etherscan.
# Target for Sepolia: 0xa8958f18de8705a0c04dfc7b64c0a7dc38b19bd7517a3030fff7cf077f3f33bc
# Target for Mainnet: 0xe37e1a183a3d1c7234d090bfb7196081635919c26f2e65c67c106513158a7db4
geth --snapshot=false --history.chain=postmerge --history.logs.disable --history.state=1 --history.transactions=1 --syncmode=full --exitwhensynced=true --mainnet --synctarget=0xe37e1a183a3d1c7234d090bfb7196081635919c26f2e65c67c106513158a7db4
```

You don't need a consensus node for this step, as you'll be telling Geth exactly which block you need.

## Step 2: Initialize the Ethrex DB

You'll need to run `ethrex` so it initializes the DB with the correct Genesis. Failing to do that will cause it to set the Genesis after the migration, removing the blocks we added from the canonical chain, making it try to sync from the first block.

### Step 3: Run the `geth2ethrex` executable

Usage is:
```shell
./geth2ethrex --input_dir <geth_db_path> --output_dir <ethrex_db_path> <block_number>
```
where:
* `<geth_db_path>` is the path to Geth's database (by default `.ethereum/geth/<chain>/chaindata`). The DB is opened read-only.
* `<ethrex_db_path>` is the path to Ethrex' database.
* `<BLOCK_NUMBER>` is the target block, typically the first post-merge block of the chain.
  * For Sepolia: 1450410
  * For Mainnet: 15537395
