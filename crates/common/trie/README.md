## Ethrex-Trie
This is the implementation of the State Trie (a Merkle Patricia Trie) used
by Ethrex.

### Benchmarking
To measure the performance of our implementation, we have a simple benchmark
that compares against [citahub's cita_trie implementation](https://github.com/citahub/cita_trie/tree/master).

To run it, you'll need rust installed of course, and you 
can run a comparison with:
```bash
make bench
```
Benches are in the `benches` folder.
