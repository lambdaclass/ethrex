## LEVM Custom Runner

Stack is represented from bottom to top. So for [1,2,3] 1 will be the element at the bottom and 3 will be the top. In LEVM our stack is implemented the other way around but I had to choose one way of doing it and this is the most conventional.

Not all the fields in the `.json` are required, in fact it isn't even necessary to provide one in the first place!
