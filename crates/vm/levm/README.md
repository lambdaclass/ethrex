## Performance metrics

### To run Flamegraph on the Ethereum Foundation tests

First install Flamegraph

```Shell
cargo install flamegraph
```

Run the tests

```Shell
make flamegraph-run-ef-tests
```

This will create a folder inside `cmd/ef_tests/levm/` named `levm_ef_test_perfgraphs` you can find the flamegraphs inside the folder `levm_ef_test_perfgraphs/flamegraph` open them with your preferred browser.

### To run Samply on the Ethereum Foundation tests

First install Samply

```Shell
cargo install --locked samply
```

Run the tests

```Shell
make samply-run-ef-tests
```

This will create a folder inside `cmd/ef_tests/levm/` named `levm_ef_test_perfgraphs` you can find the flamegraphs inside the folder `levm_ef_test_perfgraphs/samply` run

```Shell
samply load <path-to-perf-file.json>
```

samply will open Firefox with the desired profile file.
