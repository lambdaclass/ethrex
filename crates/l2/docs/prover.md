## What

The prover consists of two main components: handling incoming proving data from the `L2 proposer`, specifically the `prover_server` component, and the `zkVM`. The `prover_client` is responsible for this first part, while the `zkVM` serves as a RISC-V emulator executing code specified in `crates/l2/prover/zkvm/interface/guest/src`. 
Before the `zkVM` code (or guest), there is a directory called `interface`, which indicates that we access the `zkVM` through the "interface" crate.

In summary, the `prover_client` manages the inputs from the `prover_server` and then "calls" the `zkVM` to perform the proving process and generate the `groth16` ZK proof.

## Workflow

The `Prover Server` monitors requests for new jobs from the `Prover Client`, which are sent when the prover is available. Upon receiving a new job, the Prover generates the proof, after which the `Prover Client` sends the proof back to the `Prover Server`.

    ProverClient->>+ProverServer: ProofData::Submit(block_number, zkProof)
    ProverServer-->>-ProverClient: ProofData::SubmitAck(block_number)
```

## How

### Dev Mode

**Dependencies:**
- [RISC0](https://dev.risczero.com/api/zkvm/install)

To run the blockchain (`proposer`) and prover in conjunction in a development environment, set the following environment variable: `RISC0_DEV_MODE=1` [(docs)](https://dev.risczero.com/api/generating-proofs/dev-mode). If you are in the `crates/l2` directory, you will need to set the environment variable for `dev_mode`. The `.env.example` file should suffice.

To start the `prover_client`, use the following command:

```sh
make init-l2-prover
```

The `build_zkvm` flag is used, if you don't have the risc0's "sdk", you can build the prover without the feature to check if all the surrounding components of the `zkvm` can be compiled.

#### Quick Test

To test the `zkvm` execution quickly, the following test can be run:

```sh
cd crates/l2/prover
make perf_test_proving
```

#### Run the whole system with the prover

1. `cd crates/l2`
2. `make rm_dev_libmdbx_l2 && make down`
   - It will remove any old database, if present, stored in your computer. The absolute path of libmdbx is defined by [data_dir](https://docs.rs/dirs/latest/dirs/fn.data_dir.html).
3. `cp .env.example .env` &rarr; check if you want to change any config.
4. `make init`
   - Init the L1 in a docker container on port `8545`.
   - Deploy the needed contracts for the L2 on the L1.
   - Start the L2 locally on port `1729`.
5. In a new terminal &rarr; `make init-l2-prover`.

After this initialization the system has to be running in `dev-mode` &rarr; No proof verification.

### GPU mode

**Steps for Ubuntu 22.04 with Nvidia A4000:**

1. Install `docker` &rarr; using the [Ubuntu apt repository](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository)
   - Add the `user` you are using to the `docker` group &rarr; command: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`. (needs reboot, doing it after CUDA installation)
   - `id -nG` after reboot to check if the user is in the group.
2. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
3. Install [RISC0](https://dev.risczero.com/api/zkvm/install)
4. Install [CUDA for Ubuntu](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Ubuntu&target_version=22.04&target_type=deb_local)
   - Install `CUDA Toolkit Installer` first. Then the `nvidia-open` drivers.
5. Reboot
6. Run the following commands:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev pkg-config libclang-dev clang
echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
```

#### Proving Process Test

To test the `zkvm` proving process using a `gpu` quickly, the following test can be run:

```sh
cd crates/l2/prover
make perf_gpu
```

#### Run the whole system with the prover in Sepolia

Two servers are required: one for the `prover` and another for the `proposer`. If you run both components on the same machine, the `prover` may consume all available resources, leading to potential stuttering or performance issues for the `proposer`/`node`.

1. `prover`/`zkvm` &rarr; prover with gpu, make sure to have all the required dependencies described at the beginning of [Gpu Mode](#gpu-mode) section.
    1. `cd lambda_ethereum_rust/crates/l2`
    2. `cp .example.env` and change the `PROVER_CLIENT_PROVER_SERVER_ENDPOINT` with the ip of the other server.

The env variables needed are:

```sh
PROVER_CLIENT_PROVER_SERVER_ENDPOINT=<ip-address>:3000
RISC0_DEV_MODE=0
```

Finally, to start the `prover_client`/`zkvm`, run:

- `make init-l2-prover-gpu`

2.  `proposer` &rarr; this server just needs rust installed.
    1. `cd lambda_ethereum_rust/crates/l2`
    2. `cp .example.env` and change the addresses and the following fields:
       - `PROVER_SERVER_LISTEN_IP=0.0.0.0` &rarr; used to handle the tcp communication with the other server.
       - The `COMMITTER` and `PROVER_SERVER_VERIFIER` must be different accounts, the `DEPLOYER_ADDRESS` as well as the `L1_WATCHER` may be the same account used by the `COMMITTER`
       - `DEPLOYER_CONTRACT_VERIFIER=0xd9b0d07CeCd808a8172F21fA7C97992168f045CA` &rarr; risc0’s verifier contract deployed on Sepolia.
       - Set the `ETH_RPC_URL` to any Sepolia's endpoint.

>[!NOTE]
> Make sure to have funds, if you want to perform a quick test `0.2[ether]` on each account should be enough.

Finally, to start the `proposer`/`l2 node`, run:
    - `make rm_dev_libmdbx_l2 && make down`
    - `make init`

## Configuration

The following environment variables are available to configure the prover:

- `PROVER_SERVER_LISTEN_IP`: IP used to start the Server.
- `PROVER_SERVER_LISTEN_PORT`: Port used to start the Server.
- `PROVER_CLIENT_PROVER_SERVER_ENDPOINT`: Prover Server's Endpoint used to connect the Client to the Server.
- `PROVER_SERVER_VERIFIER_ADDRESS`: The address of the account that sends the zkProofs on-chain and interacts with the `OnChainProposer` `verify()` function.
- `PROVER_SERVER_VERIFIER_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of the account that sends the zkProofs on-chain and interacts with the `OnChainProposer` `verify()` function.

>[!NOTE]
> The `PROVER_SERVER_VERIFIER` account must differ from the `COMMITTER_L1` account.
