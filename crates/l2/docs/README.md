- [Contracts](./contracts.md): Explains the L1 and L2 smart contracts used by the system.
- [Prover](./prover.md): Details how block execution proofs are generated and verified using zkVMs.
- [State Diffs](./state_diffs.md): Specifies the format for state changes published for data availability.

- [Solc 0.29](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
  
## Quick HandsOn

Make sure docker is running!

1. `cd crates/l2`
2. `make rm-db-l2 && make down`
   - It will remove any old database, if present, stored in your computer. The absolute path of libmdbx is defined by [data_dir](https://docs.rs/dirs/latest/dirs/fn.data_dir.html).
4. `make init`
   - Init the L1 in a docker container on port `8545`.
   - Deploy the needed contracts for the L2 on the L1.
   - Start the L2 locally on port `1729`.


For more information on how to run the L2 node with the prover attached to it, the [Prover Docs](./prover.md) provides more insight.

## Bridge Assets

### Funding an L2 Account from L1

To transfer ETH from Ethereum L1 to your L2 account:

1. Prerequisites:
   - An L1 account with sufficient ETH balance, for developing purpose you can use:
      - Address: `0x8943545177806ed17b9f23f0a21ee5948ecaa776`
      - Private Key: `0xbcdf20249abf0ed6d944c0288fad489e33f66b3960d9e6229c1cd214ed3bbe31`
   - The address of the deployed CommonBridge contract. 
   - An Ethereum utility tool like [Rex](https://github.com/lambdaclass/rex)

2. Make a deposit:

   Using Rex is as simple as:
   ```Shell
   # Format: rex l2 deposit <AMOUNT> <PRIVATE_KEY> <BRIDGE_ADDRESS> [L2_RPC_URL]
   rex l2 deposit 50000000 0xbcdf20249abf0ed6d944c0288fad489e33f66b3960d9e6229c1cd214ed3bbe31 0x65dd6dc5df74b7e08e92c910122f91d7b2d5184f
   ```

3. Verification:

   Once the deposit is made you can verify the balance has increase with:
   ```Shell
   # Format: rex l2 balance <Address> [RPC_URL]
   rex l2 balance 0x8943545177806ed17b9f23f0a21ee5948ecaa776
   ```

For more information on what you can do with the CommonBridge see [here](./contracts.md).

### Withdrawing funds from the L2 to L1

1. Prerequisites:
   - An L2 account with sufficient ETH balance, for developing purpose you can use:
      - Address: `0x8943545177806ed17b9f23f0a21ee5948ecaa776`
      - Private Key: `0xbcdf20249abf0ed6d944c0288fad489e33f66b3960d9e6229c1cd214ed3bbe31`
   - The address of the deployed CommonBridge L2 contract (note here that we are calling the L2 contract instead of the L1 as in the deposit case). You can use:
      - CommonBridge L2: `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000ffff`
   - An Ethereum utility tool like [Rex](https://github.com/lambdaclass/rex).

2. Make the Withdraw:

    Using Rex we simply use the `rex l2 withdraw` command (it uses the default CommonBridge address).
    ```Shell
    # Format: rex l2 withdraw <AMOUNT> <PRIVATE_KEY> [RPC_URL]
    rex l2 withdraw 5000 0xbcdf20249abf0ed6d944c0288fad489e33f66b3960d9e6229c1cd214ed3bbe31
    ```

    If the withdraw is successful, the hash will be printed in the format:

    ```
    Withdrawal sent: <L2_WITHDRAWAL_TX_HASH>
    ...
    ```

3. Claim the Withdraw:

   After making the withdraw it has to be claimed in the L1. This is done with the L1 CommonBridge contract. We can use the Rex command `rex l2 claim-withdraw`. Here we have to use the tx hash obtained in the previous step. Also, it is necessary to wait for the block that includes the withdraw to be verified.

   ```Shell
   # Format: rex l2 claim-withdraw <L2_WITHDRAWAL_TX_HASH> <PRIVATE_KEY> <BRIDGE_ADDRESS>
   rex l2 claim-withdraw <L2_WITHDRAWAL_TX_HASH> 0xbcdf20249abf0ed6d944c0288fad489e33f66b3960d9e6229c1cd214ed3bbe31 0x65dd6dc5df74b7e08e92c910122f91d7b2d5184f
   ```

4. Verification:

   Once the withdrawal is made you can verify the balance has decrease with:
   ```Shell
   rex l2 balance 0x8943545177806ed17b9f23f0a21ee5948ecaa776
   ```

   And also increased in the L1:
   ```Shell
   rex balance 0x8943545177806ed17b9f23f0a21ee5948ecaa776
   ```

## Configuration

Configuration consists of the creation and modification of a `.env` file done automatically by the contract deployer, then each component reads the `.env` to load the environment variables. A detailed list is available in each part documentation.

## Testing

Load tests are available via L2 CLI and Makefile targets.

### Makefile

There are currently three different load tests you can run:

```
make load-test
make load-test-fibonacci
make load-test-io
```

The first one sends regular transfers between accounts, the second runs an EVM-heavy contract that computes fibonacci numbers, the third a heavy IO contract that writes to 100 storage slots per transaction.

### CLI

To have more control over the load tests and its parameters, you can use the CLI (the Makefile targets use the CLI underneath).

The tests take a list of private keys and send a bunch of transactions from each of them to some address (either the address of some account to send eth to or the address of the contract that we're interacting with). 

The CLI can be installed with the `cli` target:

```sh
make cli
```

To run the load-test, use the following command on the root of this repo:

```bash
ethrex_l2 test load --path ./test_data/private_keys.txt -i 1000 -v  --value 1
```

The command will, for each private key in the `private_keys.txt` file, send 1000 transactions with a value of `1` to a random account. If you want to send all transfers to the same account, pass

```
--to <account_address>
```

The `private_keys.txt` file contains the private key of every account we use for load tests.

Use `--help` to see more available options.

## Load test comparison against Reth

To run a load test on Reth, clone the repo, then run

```
cargo run --release -- node --chain <path_to_genesis-load-test.json> --dev --dev.block-time 5000ms --http.port 1729
```

to spin up a reth node in `dev` mode that will produce a block every 5 seconds.

Reth has a default mempool size of 10k transactions. If the load test goes too fast it will reach the limit; if you want to increase mempool limits pass the following flags:

```
--txpool.max-pending-txns 100000000 --txpool.max-new-txns 1000000000 --txpool.pending-max-count 100000000 --txpool.pending-max-size 10000000000 --txpool.basefee-max-count 100000000000 --txpool.basefee-max-size 1000000000000 --txpool.queued-max-count 1000000000
```

### Changing block gas limit

By default the block gas limit is the one Ethereum mainnet uses, i.e. 30 million gas. If you wish to change it, just edit the `gasLimit` field in the genesis file (in the case of `ethrex` it's `genesis-l2.json`, in the case of `reth` it's `genesis-load-test.json`). Note that the number has to be passed as a hextstring.

## Flamegraphs

To analyze performance during load tests (both `ethrex` and `reth`) you can use `cargo flamegraph` to generate a flamegraph of the node.

For `ethrex`, you can run the server with:

```
sudo -E CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_DEBUG=true cargo flamegraph --bin ethrex --features dev  --  --network test_data/genesis-l2.json --http.port 1729 --dev
```

For `reth`:

```
sudo cargo flamegraph --profile profiling -- node --chain <path_to_genesis-load-test.json> --dev --dev.block-time 5000ms --http.port 1729
```

### With Make Targets

There are some make targets inside the root's Makefile.

You will need two terminals:
1. `make start-node-with-flamegraph` &rarr; This starts the ethrex client.
2. `make flamegraph` &rarr; This starts a script that sends a bunch of transactions, the script will stop ethrex when the account reaches a certain balance.

### Samply

To run with samply, run

```
samply record ./target/profiling/reth node --chain ../ethrex/test_data/genesis-load-test.json --dev --dev.block-time 5000ms --http.port 1729
```
