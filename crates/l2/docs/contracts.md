## L1 side

### `CommonBridge`

Allows L1<->L2 communication from L1. It both sends messages from L1 to L2 and receives messages from L2.

#### Deposit Functions

##### Simple Deposits

- Send ETH directly to the contract address using a standard transfer
- The contract's `receive()` function automatically forwards funds to your identical address on L2
- No additional parameters needed

##### Deposits with Contract Interaction

```solidity
function deposit(DepositValues calldata depositValues) public payable
```

Parameters:

- `to`: Target address on L2
- `recipient`: Address that will receive the ETH on L2 (can differ from sender)
- `gasLimit`: Maximum gas for L2 execution
- `data`: Calldata to execute on the target L2 contract

This method enables atomic operations like:

- Depositing ETH while simultaneously interacting with L2 contracts
- Funding another user's L2 account

### `OnChainOperator`

Ensures the advancement of the L2. It is used by the operator to commit batches of blocks and verify batch proofs.
