## Roadmap

> [!NOTE]
> This roadmap is still a WIP and is subject to change.

### Milestone 1: MVP

- Sequencers **register** via an L1 smart contract.
- Any Node:
  - **follows** the Lead Sequencer **via L1 syncing**.
- Lead Sequencer:
  - is **elected through a Round-Robin** election in L1,
  - **produces** L2 blocks,
  - **posts** L2 batches to L1 during their allowed period.
- `OnChainProposer`’s `verifyBatch` method is **callable by anyone**. **Only one valid proof is needed** to advance the network.
- `OnChainProposer`’s `commitBatch` method is **callable by the lead Sequencer**.

### Milestone 2: P2P

- **Lead Sequencer**: Broadcasts `NewBlock` and `SealBatch` messages to the network.
- **Any Node**:
  - broadcasts transactions to the network;
  - receives, handles, and broadcasts `NewBlock` and `SealBatch` messages to the network;
  - on `NewBlock`s
    - validates the message signature,
    - stores the block,
    - or queue it if it is not the next one,
    - broadcasts it to the network;
  - on `SealBatch`s
    - validates the message signature;
    - seals the batch,
    - or queue it if it miss some blocks,
    - broadcasts it to the network;
- **Nodes State**: A new state emerges from the current Following state, this is the Syncing state.
  - **Next Batch**: The L2 batch being built by the lead Sequencer.
  - **Up-To-Date Nodes:** Nodes that have the last committed batch in their storage and only miss the next batch.
  - **Following:** We say that up-to-date nodes are **following** the lead Sequencer.
  - **Syncing:** Nodes are **syncing** if they are not up-to-date. They’ll stop syncing after they reach the **following** state.

#### Checkpoint 0: Transactions Broadcasting

- **All Nodes**: broadcasts transactions to the network.

#### Checkpoint 1: Dummy Based Messaging

- **Lead Sequencer**:
  - broadcasts **empty `NewBlock`** messages, as it produces blocks, to the network;
  - broadcasts **empty `SealBatch`** messages, as it seals batches, to the network.
- **Any Node**:
  - only logs `NewBlock` and `SealBatch` reception,
  - broadcasts them to the network.

#### Checkpoint 2: Non-signed Based Messaging

- **Lead Sequencer**:
  - broadcasts **non-empty `NewBlock`** messages, as it produces blocks, to the network;
    ```rust
    pub struct NewBlock {
        batch_number: u64,
        encoded_block: Vec<u8>,
    }
    ```
  - broadcasts **non-empty `SealBatch`** messages, as it seals batches, to the network.
    ```rust
    pub struct SealBatch {
        batch_number: u64,
        encoded_batch: Vec<u64>,
    }
    ```

#### Checkpoint 3: Signed Messaging

- on `NewBlock`s
  - stores the block,
  - or queue it if it is not the next one,
  - broadcasts it to the network;
- on `SealBatch`s
  - seals the batch,
  - or queue it if it miss some blocks,
  - broadcasts it to the network;

#### Checkpoint 4: Syncing

TODO

### Milestone 3: Testnet

- Web page simil [https://beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in/) to visualize
  - Sequencers.
  - Sequencing rounds and their progress.

## Run Locally

Running a based stack locally is essentially the same as running an ethrex stack but with a few differences in the deployment process:

### 1. Deploying L1 Contracts

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to have an L1 running to deploy the contracts. Run `make init-local-l1` to do so (ensure Docker running).

In a console with `crates/l2` as the current directory, run the following command to deploy the L1 contracts for a based L2:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin ethrex_l2_l1_deployer --manifest-path contracts/Cargo.toml -- \
  --eth-rpc-url http://localhost:8545 \
  --private-key 0x385c546456b6a603a1cfcaa9ec9494ba4832da08dd6bcf4de9a71e4a01b74924 \
  --genesis-l1-path ../../test_data/genesis-l1-dev.json \
  --genesis-l2-path ../../test_data/genesis-l2.json \
  --contracts-path contracts \
  --sp1.verifier-address 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000aa \
  --pico.verifier-address 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000aa \
  --risc0.verifier-address 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000aa \
  --tdx.verifier-address 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000aa \
  --aligned.aggregator-address 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000aa \
  --bridge-owner 0xacb3bb54d7c5295c158184044bdeedd9aa426607 \
  --on-chain-proposer-owner 0xacb3bb54d7c5295c158184044bdeedd9aa426607 \
  --deposit-rich \
  --private-keys-file-path ../../test_data/private_keys_l1.txt \
  --deploy-based-contracts \
  --sequencer-registry-owner 0xacb3bb54d7c5295c158184044bdeedd9aa426607
```

This command will:

1. Deploy the L1 contracts, including the based contracts `SequencerRegistry`, and a modified `OnChainProposer`.
2. Deposit funds in the accounts from `../../test_data/private_keys_l1.txt`.
3. Skip deploying the verifier contracts by specifying `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000aa` as their address. This means that the node will run in "dev mode" and that the proof verification will not be performed. This is useful for local development and testing, but should not be used in production environments.

> [!NOTE]
> Save the addresses of the deployed proxy contracts, as you will need them to run the L2 node.

### 2. Running a node

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to have an L1 running with the contracts deployed to run the L2 node. See the previous steps.

In a console with `ethrex/` (repository root) as the current directory, run the following command to start a based L2 node:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin ethrex --features l2 -- l2 init \
  --watcher.block-delay 0 \
  --eth.rpc-url http://localhost:8545 \
  --block-producer.coinbase-address 0xacb3bb54d7c5295c158184044bdeedd9aa426607 \
  --committer.l1-private-key 0xbcdf20249abf0ed6d944c0288fad489e33f66b3960d9e6229c1cd214ed3bbe31 \
  --proof-coordinator.l1-private-key 0x39725efee3fb28614de3bacaffe4cc4bd8c436257e2c8bb887c4b5c4be45e76d \
  --network test_data/genesis-l2.json \
  --datadir ethrex_l2 \
  --proof-coordinator.addr 127.0.0.1 \
  --proof-coordinator.port 4566 \
  --http.port 1729 \
  --state-updater.sequencer-registry 0xad860cee33bf496141b9f47d48c3955fa0ecf7ac \
  --l1.on-chain-proposer-address 0x0cc759688cdb4aba65f1a356c6ebdb82edca3b46 \
  --l1.bridge-address 0x765498d4d68eac9bf869a2bf9a870384c303e4f9 \
  --based
```

After running this command, the node will start syncing with the L1 and will be able to follow the lead Sequencer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If there is no state in L1 (this could happen if you are running a fresh L1), the node will display a log message indicating that it is up-to-date. This is expected behavior, as the node will not have any blocks to process until the lead Sequencer produces a new block.

> [!NOTE]
>
> 1. Replace `<DATA_DIRECTORY>`, `<SEQUENCER_REGISTRY_ADDRESS>`, `<ON_CHAIN_PROPOSER_ADDRESS>`, and `<COMMON_BRIDGE_ADDRESS>` with the appropriate values from the previous step.
> 2. If you want to run multiple nodes, ensure that the following values are different for each node:
>
> - `--proof-coordinator-listen-port`
> - `--http.port`
> - `--datadir`
> - `--committer-l1-private-key`
> - `--proof-coordinator-l1-private-key`

### 3. Becoming a Sequencer

For nodes to become lead Sequencers they need to register themselves in the `SequencerRegistry` contract. This can be done by calling the `register` method of the contract with the node's address.

To register a node as a Sequencer, you can use the following command using `rex`:

```bash
rex send <REGISTRY_CONTRACT> 1000000000000000000 <REGISTRANT_PRIVATE_KEY> -- "register(address)" <SEQUENCER_ADDRESS> // registers SEQUENCER_ADDRESS as a Sequencer supplying 1 ETH as collateral (the minimum).
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `SEQUENCER_ADDRESS` must be the address of the node's committer since it is the one that will be posting the batches to the L1.

Once registered, the node will be able to participate in the Sequencer election process and become the lead Sequencer when its turn comes.

> [!NOTE]
>
> 1. Replace `<REGISTRY_CONTRACT>`, `<REGISTRANT_PRIVATE_KEY>`, and `<SEQUENCER_ADDRESS>` with the appropriate values.
> 2. The registrant is not necessarily related to the sequencer, one could pay the registration for some else.
> 3. If only one Sequencer is registered, it will always be elected as the lead Sequencer. If multiple Sequencers are registered, they will be elected in a Round-Robin fashion (32 batches each as defined in the `SequencerRegistry` contract).
