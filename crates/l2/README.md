| 0         | Users can deposit Eth in the L1 (Ethereum) and receive the corresponding funds on the L2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ‚úÖ      |

### Milestone 0

Users can deposit Eth in the L1 (Ethereum) and receive the corresponding funds on the L2.

### Milestone 1: MVP

The network supports basic L2 functionality, allowing users to deposit and withdraw funds to join and exit the network, while also interacting with the network as they do normally on the Ethereum network (deploying contracts, sending transactions, etc).

#### Status

|           | Name                           | Description                                                                                                     | Status |

### Milestone 2: Block Execution Proofs

The L2's block execution is proven with a RISC-V zkVM and the proof is verified by the Verifier L1 contract. This work is being done in parallel with other milestones as it doesn't block anything else.

#### Status

|           | Name              | Description                                                                                                        | Status |

| Prover    | `Prover Client`   | Asks for block execution data to prove, generates proofs of execution and submits proofs to the `Prover Server`    | üèóÔ∏è     |

### Milestone 3: State diffs + Data compression + EIP 4844 (Blobs)

The network now commits to state diffs instead of the full state, lowering the commit transactions costs. These diffs are also submitted in compressed form, further reducing costs.

It also supports EIP 4844 for L1 commit transactions, which means state diffs are sent as blob sidecars instead of calldata.

#### Status

|           | Name                | Description                                                                 | Status |

| Proposer  | Prover Server       | Sends state diffs to the prover                                             | ‚ùå     |

|           | `init`              | Adapt network initialization to either send blobs or calldata               | ‚ùå     |

### Milestone 4: Custom Native token

The L2 can also be deployed using a custom native token, meaning that a certain ERC20 can be the common currency that's used for paying network fees.

#### Status

|     | Name           | Description                                                                               | Status |
| --- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
|     | `CommonBridge` | For native token withdrawals, infer the native token and reimburse the user in that token | ‚ùå     |
|     | `CommonBridge` | For native token deposits, msg.value = 0 and valueToMintOnL2 > 0                          | ‚ùå     |
|     | `CommonBridge` | Keep track of chain's native token                                                        | ‚ùå     |
|     | `deposit`      | Handle native token deposits                                                              | ‚ùå     |
|     | `withdraw`     | Handle native token withdrawals                                                           | ‚ùå     |

### Milestone 5: Security (TEEs and Multi Prover support)

The L2 has added security mechanisms in place, running on Trusted Execution Environments and Multi Prover setup where multiple guarantees (Execution on TEEs, zkVMs/proving systems) are required for settlement on the L1. This better protects against possible security bugs on implementations.

#### Status

|           | Name | Description                                          | Status |
| --------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| VM/Prover |      | Support proving with multiple different zkVMs        | ‚ùå     |
| Contracts |      | Support verifying multiple different zkVM executions | ‚ùå     |
| VM        |      | Support running the operator on a TEE environment    | ‚ùå     |

### Milestone 6: Account Abstraction

The L2 supports native account abstraction following EIP 7702, allowing for custom transaction validation logic and paymaster flows.

#### Status

|     | Name | Description | Status |
| --- | ---- | ----------- | ------ |

TODO: Expand on account abstraction tasks.

### Milestone 7: Based Contestable Rollup

The network can be run as a Based Rollup, meaning sequencing is done by the Ethereum Validator set; transactions are sent to a private mempool and L1 Validators that opt into the L2 sequencing propose blocks for the L2 on every L1 block.

#### Status

|     | Name              | Description                                                                    | Status |
| --- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
|     | `OnChainOperator` | Add methods for proposing new blocks so the sequencing can be done from the L1 | ‚ùå      |

TODO: Expand on this.

### Milestone 8: Validium

The L2 can be initialized in Validium Mode, meaning the Data Availability layer is no longer the L1, but rather a DA layer of the user's choice.

#### Status

|           | Name          | Description                                          | Status |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Contracts | BlockExecutor | Do not check data availability in Validium mode      | ‚ùå     |
| Proposer  | L1TxSender    | Do not send data in commit transactions              | ‚ùå     |
| CLI       | `init`        | Adapt network initialization to support Validium L2s | ‚ùå     |
| Misc      |               | Add a DA integration example for Validium mode       | ‚ùå     |

## Prerequisites

- [Rust (explained in the repo's main README)](../../README.md)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/))

## How to run

### Initialize the network

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before this step:
>
> 1. make sure the Docker daemon is running.
> 2. make sure you have created a `.env` file following the `.env.example` file.

```
make
```

This will setup a local Ethereum network as the L1, deploy all the needed contracts on it, then start an Ethereum Rust L2 node pointing to it.

### Restarting the network

> [!WARNING]
> This command will cleanup your running L1 and L2 nodes.

```
make restart
```

## Local L1 Rich Wallets

Most of them are [here](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package/blob/main/src/prelaunch_data_generator/genesis_constants/genesis_constants.star), but there's an extra one:

```
{
    "address": "0x3d1e15a1a55578f7c920884a9943b3b35d0d885b",
    "private_key": "0x385c546456b6a603a1cfcaa9ec9494ba4832da08dd6bcf4de9a71e4a01b74924"
}
