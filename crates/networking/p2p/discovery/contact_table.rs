//! The contacts discovery knows about, and the Kademlia routing table over them.
//!
//! Owned outright by [`DiscoveryServer`](super::DiscoveryServer) as plain state:
//! every discv4 and discv5 handler runs inside that actor's message loop, so
//! they reach the table by `&mut self` rather than paying a message hop per
//! inbound packet.
//!
//! Nothing here knows what RLPx is. A consumer that only wants discovery says
//! what makes a peer worth keeping through a [`PeerFilter`], and learns which
//! of them are worth dialing through [`ContactTable::next_dial_candidate`].
//! Whoever does dial reports back with [`ContactTable::mark_connected`] and
//! [`ContactTable::mark_disconnected`], which is all the table needs to keep
//! its candidates and its lookup pacing honest.
//!
//! The table is protocol-agnostic across the two discovery protocols. The key
//! abstraction is using `Bytes` for ping identifiers:
//! - discv4: converts H256 ping hash to Bytes
//! - discv5: already uses Bytes for req_id
//!
//! Each contact is tagged with the protocol that discovered it, allowing
//! protocol-specific lookups to only query compatible contacts.
