# This file is based upon `assertoor-tests` stability check file:
#   https://github.com/ethpandaops/assertoor-test/blob/master/assertoor-tests/stability-check.yaml
#
# We removed the consensus checks to keep it minimal. The checks removed were:
#   - check_consensus_finality
#   - check_consensus_attestation_stats
#   - check_consensus_reorgs
#   - check_consensus_forks
