# EF State Tests Runner
This module includes a runner for the EF state tests. The main steps it performs include:
- Parsing the tests, that are written in `.json` files.
- Preparing the necessary execution enviroment for each test case.
- Executing the transaction described in the test case.
- Verifying the expected post state against the obtained one.
- Generating a report with the result of executing the tests.

## What are EF State Tests?
The Ethereum Foundation State Tests are individual transactions not related to one another that test particular behavior of the EVM. Tests are usually run for multiple forks and the result of execution may vary between forks.

For more information on these tests check [the docs](https://eest.ethereum.org/main/running_tests/test_formats/state_test/#fixtureconfig).

## How to run the tests?

First, make sure you have the EF tests downloaded. This can be achieved by running:
```bash
cd cmd/ef_tests/state
make download-evm-ef-tests
```

After the `vectors/` directory is set up, run:

```bash
make run-new-runner
```

This will parse and execute everything in the `./vectors` directory by default.

> You can also run `cargo test --package ef_tests-state --test new_runner --release`

## Execution options
In case you do not want to parse and execute everything in the `vectors/` directory there are three flags that can be used to specify files to be run:

- `path`: it can be used to specify the path where the tests of interest are. It can either be a file or a directory. By default this flag is set to the `./vectors` directory.

_Example:_

```bash
make run-new-runner flags="--path ./vectors/GeneralStateTests"
```

```bash
make run-new-runner flags="--path ./vectors/GeneralStateTests/stChainId/chainId.json"
```


- `json-files`: it can be used to specify the `.json` files of interest (no need for full path). If this flag is set to some value, the `path` flag will be ignored.
_Example:_

```bash
make run-new-runner flags="--json-files chainId.json,transStorageReset.json"
```

> Note that different `.json` files are separated by a comma.


- `skip-files`: it can be used to skip certaing `.json` files.
_Example:_

```bash
make run-new-runner flags="--skip-files chainId.json,transStorageReset.json"
```

## Reports
For tests that succeded, a report can be found at:
`cmd/ef_tests/state/runner_v2/success_report.txt`

For tests that failed, a report can be found at:
`cmd/ef_tests/state/runner_v2/failure_report.txt`

If none of the tests failed the report will not get generated at all. In case any of the tests did fail, the report will show the differences with the expected post state for each failing test case.
