# Introduction

Layer 2 (L2) solutions are protocols built on top of Ethereum to increase scalability and reduce transaction costs. L2s process transactions off-chain and periodically post data or proofs back to Ethereum mainnet, inheriting its security.

**Ethrex** is a framework that lets you launch your own L2 rollup or blockchain. With ethrex, you can deploy, run, and experiment with custom L2 networks, taking advantage of Ethereum's security while enabling high throughput and low fees.

## Get started with your L2

Check out the [L2 quickstart guide](../getting-started/quickstart-l2.md) to start your rollup in just a command, or jump right into the [Deploy an L2](./deploy.md) for more detailed instructions.
