# Run a prover

This section provides step-by-step guides for running an ethrex L2 prover, which is responsible for generating ZK proofs for L2 blocks. These proofs are then submitted to L1 for verification, finalizing the state of your L2.

Use this section to choose which prover setup best fits your already deployed ethrex L2 and follow the instructions accordingly.
