# Case Studies

This page showcases how teams are using ethrex in production and research environments.

## Why Teams Choose ethrex

| Value Proposition | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Reduced Complexity** | ~100k lines of Rust vs 500k+ in mature clients means faster audits and easier customization |
| **Multi-prover Flexibility** | Switch between SP1, RISC Zero, ZisK, or TEEs without changing your deployment |
| **ZK-First Architecture** | Optimized data structures that reduce proving costs from day one |
| **Unified Codebase** | Same client for L1 nodes and L2 rollups simplifies operations |
| **Active Development** | Rapid iteration with direct access to the development team |
