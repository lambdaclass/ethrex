# Getting started

## L1 and L2 support

This client supports running in two different modes:

- As a regular Ethereum execution client
- As a multi-prover ZK-Rollup (supporting SP1, RISC Zero and TEEs), where block execution is proven and the proof sent to an L1 network for verification, thus inheriting the L1's security. Support for based sequencing is currently in the works.

We call the first one ethrex L1 and the second one ethrex L2.
