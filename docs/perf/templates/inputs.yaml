# Input Diversity Template
# Copy this file to your experiment directory and fill in the values.
# Example: docs/perf/experiments/001-optimization-name/inputs.yaml
#
# IMPORTANT: Never benchmark with a single input type.
# Select diverse inputs to ensure optimizations generalize.

inputs:
  # Light workload - lower bound, sanity check
  - name: "light"
    path: ""            # Path to input file or block range
    description: "Few transactions, minimal complexity"
    characteristics:
      - "low tx count"
      - "no precompiles"

  # Heavy storage - tests state operations
  - name: "storage_heavy"
    path: ""
    description: "Many SLOAD/SSTORE operations"
    characteristics:
      - "high storage access"
      - "state-intensive"

  # Precompile heavy - tests crypto patches (if applicable)
  - name: "precompile_heavy"
    path: ""
    description: "Many precompile calls"
    characteristics:
      - "ECRECOVER calls"
      # Add other precompiles as needed:
      # - "BN254 calls"
      # - "BLS12-381 calls"

  # Typical workload - representative case
  - name: "typical"
    path: ""
    description: "Representative average workload"
    characteristics:
      - "mixed transactions"
      - "realistic gas usage"

# For random/synthetic inputs
# random:
#   seed: 12345          # Deterministic seed for reproducibility
#   count: 5             # Number of random inputs generated
#   parameters:
#     min_txs: 10
#     max_txs: 100
#     include_precompiles: true

# Weights for calculating weighted average improvement
# weights:
#   light: 0.1
#   storage_heavy: 0.2
#   precompile_heavy: 0.2
#   typical: 0.5
