# Developer docs

Welcome to the ethrex developer docs!

This section contains documentation on the internals of the project.

To get started first, read the developer [installation guide](./installing.md) to learn about ethrex and its features. Then you can look into the [L1 developer docs](../developers/l1/introduction.md) or the [L2 developer docs](../developers/l2/introduction.md)
