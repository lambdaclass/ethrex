## 2. High-Risk Components
- [crates/vm/backends/levm/tracing.rs:11](https://github.com/lambdaclass/ethrex/blob/25ee6a95a6ccf329be87aecf903483fbc34796d0/crates/vm/backends/levm/tracing.rs#L11) `LEVM::rerun_block`: Partial block replays break out before withdrawals when `stop_index` is set, leaving state mutations without the associated settlement; callers must treat the database as dirty whenever the loop exits early.
- [crates/vm/backends/levm/mod.rs:325](https://github.com/lambdaclass/ethrex/blob/25ee6a95a6ccf329be87aecf903483fbc34796d0/crates/vm/backends/levm/mod.rs#L325) `LEVM::prepare_block`: Fork-gated system-contract invocations can silently skip required updates if headers are missing fields (`parent_beacon_block_root`) or if fork detection drifts; the method also short-circuits entirely for `VMType::L2`, so any shared callers must guard their expectations.
- [crates/vm/backends/mod.rs:104](https://github.com/lambdaclass/ethrex/blob/25ee6a95a6ccf329be87aecf903483fbc34796d0/crates/vm/backends/mod.rs#L104) `Evm::apply_system_calls`: Duplicates the fork checks from `prepare_block`; divergence between the wrapper and backend implementation could trigger redundant system calls or skip operations during upgrades.

## 3. Concurrency Observations
- Witness database access goes through `GuestProgramStateWrapper`, an `Arc<Mutex<GuestProgramState>>`; every helper acquires a fresh lock and maps poisoning to broad `EvmError::DB` messages, obscuring failure provenance ([crates/vm/witness_db.rs:24](https://github.com/lambdaclass/ethrex/blob/25ee6a95a6ccf329be87aecf903483fbc34796d0/crates/vm/witness_db.rs#L24)).
- `DatabaseLogger` wraps an underlying `LevmDatabase` with multiple `Arc<Mutex<_>>` guards; nested `lock()` calls plus generic `DatabaseError::Custom("Could not lock mutex")` messaging complicate diagnosing contention during heavy tracing ([crates/vm/backends/levm/db.rs:35](https://github.com/lambdaclass/ethrex/blob/25ee6a95a6ccf329be87aecf903483fbc34796d0/crates/vm/backends/levm/db.rs#L35)).
- No async constructs today, but the heavy reliance on synchronous `Mutex` implies that plugging this crate into async contexts requires care to avoid blocking executors.

## 4. Engineering Complexity Score
- **Score: 2 / 5** â€” Small surface area with limited branching, but the stateful replay helpers and mutex-based database bridges still warrant careful regression coverage, especially around fork upgrades.

## 5. Recommendations
1. Add targeted tests covering `rerun_block` with and without `stop_index` to ensure database state and withdrawal handling align with caller expectations ([crates/vm/backends/levm/tracing.rs:11](https://github.com/lambdaclass/ethrex/blob/25ee6a95a6ccf329be87aecf903483fbc34796d0/crates/vm/backends/levm/tracing.rs#L11)).
2. Consolidate the fork-gated system-contract logic so the public `Evm` wrapper and backend share one implementation, reducing the risk of divergence during hard-fork rollouts ([crates/vm/backends/mod.rs:104](https://github.com/lambdaclass/ethrex/blob/25ee6a95a6ccf329be87aecf903483fbc34796d0/crates/vm/backends/mod.rs#L104), [crates/vm/backends/levm/mod.rs:325](https://github.com/lambdaclass/ethrex/blob/25ee6a95a6ccf329be87aecf903483fbc34796d0/crates/vm/backends/levm/mod.rs#L325)).
3. Preserve underlying mutex error information (e.g., include `error` details) when mapping failures to `EvmError`/`DatabaseError`, improving observability for witness generation and tracing pipelines ([crates/vm/witness_db.rs:64](https://github.com/lambdaclass/ethrex/blob/25ee6a95a6ccf329be87aecf903483fbc34796d0/crates/vm/witness_db.rs#L64), [crates/vm/backends/levm/db.rs:36](https://github.com/lambdaclass/ethrex/blob/25ee6a95a6ccf329be87aecf903483fbc34796d0/crates/vm/backends/levm/db.rs#L36)).

## 6. Follow-Ups / Tooling Ideas
- Consider lightweight tracing spans or counters around `GuestProgramStateWrapper` operations to spot long-held locks or poisoning events in witness workflows.
- If async consumption is planned, prototype replacing synchronous mutexes with actor messages or async-aware guards to avoid blocking upstream runtimes.
