- Files analyzed: 45 Rust sources (tests inline, no sibling crates)
- Functions: 501 total with 56 flagged as complex (heuristic: ≥60 lines or high branch count)
- Longest production routine: [sync.rs:817](https://github.com/lambdaclass/ethrex/blob/31e19504485904c70bd5294aa65becf91358d0e3/crates/networking/p2p/sync.rs#L817) (`snap_sync`, 409 lines, 30 branches)
- Async/concurrency signals (crate-wide):
  - `async fn`: 173
  - `.await`: 505
  - `spawn_blocking`: 11
  - `tokio::spawn`: 6
  - `tokio::sync::mpsc`: 14, `broadcast`: 2
  - `Arc<...>`: 75, atomics: 39
  - Mutexes: `tokio::sync::Mutex` (3) — concentrated in `metrics.rs`, `kademlia.rs`, `utils.rs`
  - No `unsafe` blocks detected

## 2. High-Risk Components
- **Snap Synchronization (`sync.rs`)**
  - `snap_sync` coordinates block/state download, file IO, and metric locks; mixes blocking `std::fs` reads with async contexts.
  - Healing helpers (`state_healing.rs`, `storage_healing.rs`) spawn tasks while sharing mutable state and metrics, raising contention risk.
- **Peer Orchestration (`peer_handler.rs`)**
  - Twelve functions exceed the complexity threshold; heavy branching around retries, timeouts, and snapshot file writes.
  - Uses `Arc<Mutex<mpsc::Receiver<_>>>` and long-lived awaits, creating potential bottlenecks.
- **RLPx Connection Server (`rlpx/connection/server.rs`)**
  - Message dispatchers (`handle_peer_message`, `handle_cast`) exceed 200 lines, mixing broadcast fan-out, tokio tasks, and shared sinks guarded by `Arc<Mutex<_>>`.
- **Discovery/Kademlia (`kademlia.rs`)**
  - Global peer tables stored in `Arc<Mutex<BTreeMap<...>>>`; every peer lookup locks large maps, affecting scalability.
- **Metrics Subsystem (`metrics.rs`)**
  - Combines `AtomicU64` counters with `Arc<Mutex<_>>` deques and maps; 178-line `update_failures_grouped_by_reason` iterates under lock, potentially blocking signal handlers.
- **Snap Request Handlers (`snap.rs`)**
  - Heavy use of `spawn_blocking` for database iterators within async entry points; 545-line `setup_initial_state` lives under `#[cfg(test)]`, distorting max-length metrics but not impacting runtime.
- **Actor Integration Hotspots (multiple files)**
  - Actor-based modules (`kademlia.rs`, `tx_broadcaster.rs`, `rlpx/connection/server.rs`, `discv4/server.rs`) leverage `spawned_concurrency::tasks::GenServer`, but several still wrap shared state in `Arc<Mutex<_>>` (e.g., peer tables, per-connection receivers). Flag these for migration toward pure actor message passing to stay aligned with the `spawned` strategy.

## 3. Concurrency Observations
- Blocking filesystem/database loops (`std::fs::read_dir`, storage iterators) run inside async functions; they should be isolated or wrapped with `spawn_blocking` consistently.
- Shared state relies on coarse `Arc<Mutex<_>>` locks (peer tables, metrics, connection sinks). Contention likely grows with peer count.
- Broadcast channels (`tokio::sync::broadcast`) plus per-peer tasks introduce fan-out complexity; message duplication logic sits inside the same critical sections as sink writes.
- Actor components built with `spawned_concurrency` handle many workflows, but the mixed use of actors and mutexes suggests transitional architecture. Document which actors can assume ownership of shared state so the remaining locks can be eliminated.

## 4. Engineering Complexity Score
- **Score: 5 / 5**
  - Large body of code with 56 complex routines across networking, sync, and metrics modules.
  - Numerous long-lived async tasks, shared mutable state, and blocking operations mixed with async runtime.
  - Multi-protocol coordination (RLPx, snap, discovery, metrics) magnifies maintenance and concurrency risk.

## 5. Recommendations
1. **Separate Blocking Workloads**: Move filesystem/database loops (e.g., snapshot ingestion in `sync.rs`) into dedicated worker services or consistently wrap in `spawn_blocking`, returning structured results.
2. **Align With Actor Model**: Audit `Arc<Mutex<_>>` usages in actor-enabled modules (`kademlia`, `peer_handler`, `rlpx`) and migrate those responsibilities into `spawned` actors or message queues to remove shared locks.
3. **Break Down Orchestration Routines**: Refactor `snap_sync`, `handle_peer_message`, and `peer_handler` request flows into smaller units with explicit lock boundaries; add tracing around lock acquisition and long waits to identify hot spots.
4. **Metrics Tightening**: Offload metrics aggregation from request paths (e.g., accumulate in lock-free queues and flush periodically) to avoid locking during high-traffic periods.

## 6. Follow-Ups / Tooling Ideas
- Run `tokio-console` or tracing spans around lock acquire/release to monitor contention.
- Add targeted integration tests for snap sync and peer lifecycle to guard refactors.
- Consider static analysis tooling (e.g., `cargo geiger` for async/unsafe flags, `cargo-llvm-lines` for code hotspots) to keep complexity visible.
